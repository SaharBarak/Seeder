# Seeder
# Decentralized Kubernetes Orchestrator Based on P2P Blockchain Network of Mobile Devices

This project implements a decentralized Kubernetes orchestrator using a peer-to-peer blockchain network of mobile devices. By leveraging user participation, it provides a cost-free infrastructure for orchestrating containerized applications.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Orchestration**: Utilize mobile devices to create a scalable Kubernetes cluster.
- **No Operational Costs**: Eliminate traditional cloud infrastructure expenses through user participation.
- **P2P Network**: Efficient task distribution and load balancing using peer-to-peer protocols.
- **IPFS Storage**: Decentralized storage for containerized applications and data.
- **IOTA Microtransactions**: Reward users with IOTA tokens for their computational contributions.
- **Carbon Offsets**: Receive carbon offsets for avoiding unsustainable traditional cloud computing.

## Technologies Used
- **Android**: Enables mobile devices to act as Kubernetes nodes.
- **Docker**: Containerization of applications.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration and management of containerized applications.
- **IPFS**: Decentralized file storage.
- **IOTA**: Microtransactions for incentivizing participation.
- **P2P Networking**: Facilitates communication and coordination between devices.

## How It Works
1. **Develop as Usual**: Create your application as you normally would, including all Kubernetes YAML configurations.
2. **Upload to Seeder**: Upload your entire Kubernetes cluster, including all YAML configurations, to the seeder network.
3. **Sharding and Scaling**: Your application will be sharded and scaled across the participants.
4. **Increased Resilience**: Each participant increases the availability and resilience of the application.
5. **No Cloud Fees**: Avoid fees for cloud networks.
6. **Carbon Offsets**: Receive carbon offsets for contributing to a sustainable, decentralized computing model.

## Uploading Your Kubernetes Cluster
1. Package your Kubernetes cluster configurations:
   - Ensure all YAML files (e.g., deployments, services, config maps) are included.
   - Compress the files into a single archive (e.g., `kubectl create -f <your_yaml_files>`).

2. Upload to the Seeder Network:
   - Use the app to upload the compressed archive to the IPFS network.
   - The app will handle the distribution and deployment across the P2P network.

3. Monitor and Manage:
   - Use the app to monitor the status of your Kubernetes deployments.
   - Manage resources and track your contributions and rewards in IOTA.

Join us in creating a community-driven, decentralized infrastructure powered by mobile devices.
